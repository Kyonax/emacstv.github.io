* ðŸ¦¬ emacs.tv

[[https://emacs.tv][emacs.tv]] aggregates videos related to our favorite text editor [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].

This project was born out of a [[https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JF94JQQNNRXMTKN3Y1774TFP][collaboration]] between [[https://sachachua.com/blog/][Sacha Chua]] and [[https://lmno.lol/alvaro][Alvaro Ramirez]].

* Watch videos

You can use the random feature at https://emacs.tv (requires Javascript), search for text in the page, or filter by tag/speaker.

If you have the [[https://mpv.io][MPV media player]] and the [[https://github.com/kljohann/mpv.el/tree/master][mpv.el]] package (available on MELPA and NonGNU ELPA), you can install emacstv.el from this repo:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package emacstv
	:vc (:url "https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io"))
#+end_src

Then use:

- ~M-x emacstv-play-random~: play a random video
- ~M-x emacstv-background-mode~: play one video after another until you disable it by calling ~M-x emacstv-background-mode~ again.
- ~M-x emacstv-play~: select a video by typing in part of its title or speakers
