noticed this seems like it</text><text start="303.669" dur="3.331">helps you get more work done and give</text><text start="305.59" dur="3.87">you more free time to work on other</text><text

like this work thing is</text><text start="328.84" dur="4.47">a thing that&amp;#39;s separate from us and that</text><text start="330.34" dur="6.15">our play and that our hobby is

dur="2.761">improve your keyboard and you build</text><text start="367.36" dur="3.45">macros and you build automation for</text><text start="368.86" dur="4.23">yourself and you build tools to help

dur="6.59">which is quite true and I know more</text><text start="438.16" dur="7.62">about finding Emacs and I choose Emacs</text><text start="442.29" dur="5.47">this section please don&amp;#39;t tell

Emacs right okay</text><text start="479.26" dur="4.26">best thing about vim and Emacs are their</text><text start="481.419" dur="3.781">age people have been improving them for</text><text start="483.52" dur="3.57">decades and it&amp;#39;s simply impossible to</text><text start="485.2" dur="3.66">know all of the possibilities just</text><text start="487.09" dur="3.87">skimming through VIMS help file will</text><text start="488.86" dur="4.11">always reveal something useful that you</text><text start="490.96" dur="4.68">probably didn&amp;#39;t even know about and was</text><text start="492.97" dur="6.15">developed before you were born that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="495.64" dur="8.279">that&amp;#39;s extremely true of both bits of</text><text start="499.12" dur="6.87">software it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s incredible a lot</text><text start="503.919" dur="5.361">of vim plugins are things that are</text><text start="505.99" dur="8.52">handled in vanilla vim and there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="509.28" dur="8.28">there&amp;#39;s a video called how to do most in</text><text start="514.51" dur="5.52">vim with</text><text start="517.56" dur="4.99">most with vanilla vim or something like</text><text start="520.03" dur="7.02">that and replicate plugins with vanilla</text><text start="522.55" dur="11.79">vim but that&amp;#39;s beside the point</text><text start="527.05" dur="9.39">okay so MIM features of vim exiting this</text><text start="534.34" dur="5.51">is important</text><text start="536.44" dur="5.88">press escape : q and then press Enter</text><text start="539.85" dur="5.68">alternatively you can press escape and</text><text start="542.32" dur="9.03">then Capital Z capital Q that&amp;#39;ll get you</text><text start="545.53" dur="8.52">out of vim very important but the main</text><text start="551.35" dur="5.91">feature of them is its modality and I</text><text start="554.05" dur="4.89">think people have problems with that for</text><text start="557.26" dur="5.97">some reason I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t understand</text><text start="558.94" dur="7.02">why but basically if you&amp;#39;re opening a</text><text start="563.23" dur="5.4">notepad you&amp;#39;re basically an input mode</text><text start="565.96" dur="4.65">everything you type goes into the text</text><text start="568.63" dur="3.63">buffer of the screen of the thing that</text><text start="570.61" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re typing into the file that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="572.26" dur="3.3">typing into and when you press arrows it</text><text start="574.18" dur="3.66">moves the cursor around which will</text><text start="575.56" dur="6.84">change the point at which you do stuff</text><text start="577.84" dur="7.05">in that file normal mode normal mode is</text><text start="582.4" dur="6">the function mode it&amp;#39;s where every key</text><text start="584.89" dur="7.98">on this keyboard is a function every key</text><text start="588.4" dur="6.27">does a thing so you think about if you</text><text start="592.87" dur="3.57">go grab your mouse which you shouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="594.67" dur="4.41">do then click on file and it has all</text><text start="596.44" dur="5.51">those options in there you get to do</text><text start="599.08" dur="5.93">that but with every key on your keyboard</text><text start="601.95" dur="6.19">so just think about that think about</text><text start="605.01" dur="7.6">completely eliminating any form of menu</text><text start="608.14" dur="5.97">navigation just going okay leader key</text><text start="612.61" dur="3.09">the leader key is an extension of</text><text start="614.11" dur="3.39">function mode remember how I said you</text><text start="615.7" dur="4.23">would have every key on your keyboard is</text><text start="617.5" dur="5.52">a function well if you use the leader</text><text start="619.93" dur="5.22">key which I highly recommend you do when</text><text start="623.02" dur="4.02">you press that leader key every key on</text><text start="625.15" dur="4.77">your keyboard becomes another function</text><text start="627.04" dur="5.73">so and that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s recursive too you</text><text start="629.92" dur="4.86">can hit leader key twice and then have</text><text start="632.77" dur="4.89">every key on the keyboard do another</text><text start="634.78" dur="4.68">function so you have these like layers</text><text start="637.66" dur="2.58">you can just build on these functions</text><text start="639.46" dur="2.85">forever</text><text start="640.24" dur="3.99">and these functions that you might not</text><text start="642.31" dur="4.11">even use that often you can hide away in</text><text start="644.23" dur="5.66">some corner with you know leader key</text><text start="646.42" dur="5.43">leader keikyu will do that thing and</text><text start="649.89" dur="4.75">it&amp;#39;s fun that you don&amp;#39;t have to think</text><text start="651.85" dur="5.67">about that you know you can make them do</text><text start="654.64" dur="5.87">all these things and package it as a</text><text start="657.52" dur="5.28">function and then just fire it easy</text><text start="660.51" dur="4.84">there&amp;#39;s a visual mode visual mode

start="1120.159" dur="5.221">you&amp;#39;ve just built the macro by just</text><text start="1122.89" dur="4.32">using them you&amp;#39;re inputting into a</text><text start="1125.38" dur="4.59">buffer where you can basically do</text><text start="1127.21" dur="4.469">whatever you just did as efficiently or</text><text start="1129.97" dur="4.26">in efficiently as possible</text><text start="1131.679" dur="3.171">you can repeat that over and over and</text><text start="1134.23" dur="2.39">over Oh</text><text start="1134.85" dur="4.05">and over and you can even play that back</text><text start="1136.62" dur="3.57">and record it into a bit of em script so</text><text start="1138.9" dur="4.47">that it becomes a function that you can</text><text start="1140.19" dur="4.8">always call so even if you&amp;#39;re just like</text><text start="1143.37" dur="3.06">fiddling around with file and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1144.99" dur="3.45">like let me move

you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1157.56" dur="7.14">it how inefficient your command is if</text><text start="1160.23" dur="6.18">you do that you can play it back and it</text><text start="1164.7" dur="5.46">plays it back instantly or more or less</text><text start="1166.41" dur="7.65">instantly so it&amp;#39;s very very fast very</text><text start="1170.16" dur="8.04">very quick to start customizing live</text><text start="1174.06" dur="7.35">kiri Maps really any form of user input</text><text start="1178.2" dur="6.06">that&amp;#39;s just I can take you know when I</text><text start="1181.41" dur="5.28">press a I can make a kick off a function</text><text start="1184.26" dur="5.49">and if I&amp;#39;m typing in the computer I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1186.69" dur="4.95">typing in input mode I can make it so</text><text start="1189.75" dur="3.78">that when I type a certain thing it</text><text start="1191.64" dur="3.84">kicks off another function when I type</text><text start="1193.53" dur="3.47">JK in rapid succession it kicks off a</text><text start="1195.48" dur="4.65">function that gets me out of that mode</text><text start="1197" dur="6.43">so pretty much anything you type into</text><text start="1200.13" dur="5.82">vim you can customize at any point even</text><text start="1203.43" dur="5.25">if you open up a command window you

dur="5.041">feature then you can write something up</text><text start="1590.86" dur="4.5">write a plug-in and add it yourself it</text><text start="1593.35" dur="4.98">is with vim script script and vim script</text><text start="1595.36" dur="4.59">is a little weird but it does work and</text><text start="1598.33" dur="2.969">there&amp;#39;s lots of people out there making</text><text
