This mode allows you to integrate with the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) and debug your code directly within Emacs.\n\n**DAP Mode vs. LSP DAP Mode**\n\nThere are two main DAP modes for Emacs: the newer DAP mode and the older LSP DAP mode. DAP mode is more closely aligned with Emacs Lisp primitives, making it more flexible and powerful. However, LSP DAP mode is simpler to set up and works well with LSP servers.\n\n**Debugging a Go Project**\n\nTo illustrate, I'll use a Go project as an example. First, I'll set a breakpoint using a custom function that highlights the line for better visibility. This function is a workaround for a known issue with breakpoint markers being hidden.\n\n**Starting the Debugger**\n\nI'll start the debugging session using a configuration file that specifies the debugger (dlv in this case), the program to debug, and other relevant settings. Once the debugger starts, you'll see the current scope, variables, and logs in the Emacs window.\n\n**Interacting with the Debugger**\n\nYou can interact with the debugger using various commands:\n\n- **Stepping:** Step over, into, or out of functions.\n- **Breakpoints:** Set, clear, and condition breakpoints.\n- **Variables:** Inspect variable values.\n- **Expressions:** Evaluate expressions.\n\n**Integration with LSP**\n\nDAP mode integrates seamlessly with LSP, providing features like:\n\n- **Code completion:** Suggest variable and function names.\n- **Go-to-definition:** Jump to the definition of a symbol.\n- **Hover documentation:** Display documentation for symbols.\n\n**Debugging Tests**\n\nTo debug tests, I use a custom function that automatically sets up the debugger for the current test function. This function leverages the `go-test` library to identify the test and start the debugger with the appropriate arguments.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDAP mode is a powerful tool for debugging your code within Emacs. By leveraging its integration with LSP and other Emacs features, you can significantly improve your debugging workflow.\n\n\n---\n#emacs #coding #golang"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f9Rvk6dulM","DURATION":"15:37","DATE":"2024-12-13","SPEAKERS":"Category's Solo Game Table","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":fun:emacsgme:rpg:games:","TAGS":":fun:emacsgme:rpg:games:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"EmacsGME - Solo Roleplaying inside the Emacs Text Editor","DESCRIPTION":"This video is a little showcase for the nerd-crossover event of the season, a solo RPG system inside Emacs!

From it original intend,\r\n   Org-mode is a system for structured note-taking and project planning.\r\n   It uses strictly plain text files, making it a truly portable,\r\n   system-independent solution. The project-planning features are\r\n   implemented using a fairly simple outlining paradigm, upon which\r\n   meta-data concepts like due dates, priorities, TODO states and tags\r\n   are overlayed in a non-intrusive way. Besides outlining the system\r\n   and its basic concepts, I will give background information into the\r\n   history of Org-mode and discuss the properties of such an evolved\r\n   system compared to a top-down designed one.

In the video, I unintentionally stumble upon a priority dispute over who actually wrote and designed the original Emacs, and I ask ChatGPT to render its judgment.\n\n  Then, about 23 minutes in, I start digging into the code for GNU Emacs. Gnu Emacs dates back to the mid 1980s and is easily the most popular surviving Emacs implementation.\n\n  Correction: I said I thought Steele was one of the authors of the \"famous Lisp book,\" but that's incorrect. I was thinking of the book \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,\" often called SICP.

But start with the basics!\n\n  Headings\n  Everything in org mode starts with headings in files. You open a file (with a .org extension, and you start adding headings.\n\n  Headings are identified by asterisks (*, or “stars”) and they are hierarchical, which means they can be nested in multiple levels.\n\n  * Heading level 1\n  ** Heading level 2\n  *** Heading level 3 (and so forth)\n\n  Headings can be rearranged in any order by holding down the Meta (or, Alt) key and using the arrows on your keyboard.\n\n  Tags\n\n  Tags are used to additional context to heading items.\n\n  To add a tag, you can hover over a heading and click C-c C-c. You will be prompted to add a tag. Tab auto completion works here as well, if you want to assign an existing tag.\n\n  Lists\n  Org mode offers some powerful list-making tools. You can use dashes to start lists:\n\n  - Item 1\n  - Item 2\n  - Item 3\n  Then you can check boxes to these lists:\n\n  - [ ] Take out garbage\n  - [ ] Prepare tax declaration\n  - [ ] Start a business\n  You can check and uncheck these items with C-c C-c. (This keystroke does a lot of magical things in org mode.)\n\n  You can also use progress indicators to see how much of the list is complete:\n\n  - My list [/] [%]\n   - [ ] Take out garbage\n   - [ ] Prepare tax declaration\n   - [ ] Start a business\n  Watch the progress indicators move as you complete your list."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"07:00","SPEAKERS":"Chris Maiorana","DATE":"2022-12-16T05:00:29-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpDLzjXG5-M&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs | Never Lose a File Again?","DESCRIPTION":"Today, let's learn about how you can keep track of files in your org mode log system, however you choose to organize it.

А это уже даёт хорошую платформу для старта.\n            Так же хотел, что бы Вы узнали о Emacs и попробовали его, обязательно получится сделать среду своей мечты, ведь это прекрасно, когда вам то одного не хватает, и вы доделываете, потом следующее и следующее и у вас появится среда, которая вас будет радовать и вы полностью откажетесь от мыши, к этому стремится любой программист.\n  Уроки здесь\n  https://spb-tut.ru/%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8-django-4/django4-views-blog/category/views-blog/?page=6\n\n  -----------------\n\n  Выбери свой доступ.\n\n  Джанго + Питон:\n  https://spb-tut.ru/programming_school/pay-django4/\n  Либо Джанго + Питон + Блокчейн:\n  Внизу страницы 400 BYN:\n  https://spb-tut.ru/programming_school/pay-dapp-spb-tut-ru/\n\n  Обучение программированию по индивидуальной программе.\n  https://spb-tut.ru/programming_school/individual-programming-training/\n\n  Групповые занятия по программированию.\n  https://spb-tut.ru/programming_school/group-programming-lessons/\n\n  Все получится точно.\n\n  #jqueryajaxdjango"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:54:05","SPEAKERS":"System Crafters","DATE":"2022-12-23T22:01:50-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiP09XwdvKw","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Expanding the Craft in 2023 - System Crafters Live!","DESCRIPTION":"Turn your videos into live streams with Restream https://restre.am/ANIm\n\n  In today's stream, we'll discuss the plans I have for the System Crafters channel and community in 2023!

Are you worried that your colleagues will expect more from you and that it would be safer to use VS Code or whatever the others are using? Here's how I solved that when I started out as a developer in 2003:\n\n  1) Setup the development stack that \"everyone\" around you are using (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse)\n  2) In your spare time, set up Emacs to do the same\n  3) Configure both editors to auto reload files so you can quickly Alt+Tab between them\n  4) As you grow into the job, so will your Emacs setup\n  5) As months go by, you'll use Emacs more and more and the \"everyone editor\" less and less.\n\n  With this approach, you can take your time to ease into the job, learn all the other things you must in order to deliver. At the same time, when time allows, you can re-create the setup using your preferred tools, like Emacs.\n\n  To have Emacs automatically reload files changed in VS Code, IntelliJ++, I use:\n  ```\n  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)\n  ```\n\n  ## My Emacs conf\n  - https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/tree/master/emacs\n\n  ## Connect\n  🕸️ https://skybert.net\n  🐘 https://emacs.ch/@skybert\n  📫 torstein@skybert.net\n\n  #emacs #linux #newbie #newjob"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"10:25","SPEAKERS":"Lex Clips","DATE":"2022-11-26T15:00:06-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5mtQhWNezQ","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":python:","TAGS":":python:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Best Python IDE: Vim, Emacs, PyCharm, or Visual Studio Code? | Guido van Rossum and Lex Fridman","DESCRIPTION":"Lex Fridman Podcast full episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DVyjdw4t9I\n  Please support this podcast by checking out our sponsors:\n  - GiveDirectly: https://givedirectly.org/lex to get gift matched up to $1000\n  - Eight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/lex to get special savings\n  - Fundrise: https://fundrise.com/lex\n  - InsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/lex to get 20% off\n  - Athletic Greens: https://athleticgreens.com/lex to get 1 month of fish oil\n\n  GUEST BIO:\n  Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python programming language.\n\n  PODCAST INFO:\n  Podcast website: https://lexfridman.com/podcast\n  Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/2lwqZIr\n  Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\n  RSS: https://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\n  Full episodes playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\n  Clips playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\n  SOCIAL:\n  - Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n  - Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lexfridman\n  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n  - Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n  - Reddit: https://reddit.com/r/lexfridman\n  - Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:31","SPEAKERS":"Anand Tamariya","DATE":"2022-11-21T23:39:52-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/5nlvGHL-ex4","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Fill PDF form using GNU Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Details: https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2022/10/take-charge-of-pdf-in-gnu-emacs.html"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"59:22","SPEAKERS":"NapoleonWils0n","DATE":"2022-11-23T08:49:04-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StbSdYcLucE","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Desktop Notification Center","DESCRIPTION":"The Emacs Desktop Notification Center (EDNC) is an Emacs package written in pure Lisp that implements a Desktop Notifications service according to the freedesktop.org specification.\n\n  EDNC aspires to be a small, but flexible drop-in replacement of standalone daemons like Dunst.\n\n  emacs desktop notification center\n  https://github.com/sinic/ednc\n\n  emacs init.el\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/ubuntu-dotfiles/blob/master/.config/emacs/init.el\n\n  disable gnome notifications\n  https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/cerberus/blob/master/ubuntu/nognome_notifications_setup/nognome_notifications.org"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:50:50","SPEAKERS":"System Crafters","DATE":"2022-11-18T22:09:30-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C16LLHGYzk","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Converting a Literate Org Config to Guix Home - System Crafters Live!","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:50:50","SPEAKERS":"System Crafters","DATE":"2022-11-18T22:09:30-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C16LLHGYzk","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Converting a Literate Org Config to Guix Home - System Crafters Live!","DESCRIPTION":"In today's stream, we'll try to convert the relevant parts of my literate system configuration (written with Org Babel) to Guix Home!

In Emacs?! by Zachary Kanfer","DESCRIPTION":"Making Music! In Emacs?! by Zachary Kanfer\n\n  During quarantine, I found myself spending time with an Android app. One of the features this app has is composing music that loops endlessly. As with many programs, I wondered how much better this feature would be, if only it was inside Emacs. This talk explains how I made zmusic, my implementation inside Emacs, with detours through Emacs text properties, font rendering, the WAVE file format, and music theory.

Non c'è bisogno sempre di scegliere strumento più potente, perché il potere può si aiutare in tanti contesti, ma può anche creare danni in tanti altri contesti, specialmente nel mondo dell'informatica e dunque della sicurezza informatica.\n\n  ------------------------------------\n\n  MATERIALE ORIGINALE:\n\n  https://blog.leonardotamiano.xyz/posts/how-i-manage-my-blog/\n  https://academy.leonardotamiano.xyz/video/x3GhiF-1R0Q.html\n\n  ------------------------------------\n\n  RIFERIMENTI ESTERNI:\n\n  https://gohugo.io/\n  https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/\n\n  ------------------------------------\n\n  TIMESTAMPS:\n\n  00:00 introduzione\n  02:26 che cos'è un sito web statico?\n  11:30 perché ho scelto di utilizzare un sito web statico\n  14:50 come utilizzare hugo (markdown 〉html)\n  32:40 come utilizzare ox-hugo (org mode  〉markdown)\n  44:00 conclusioni\n\n  ------------------------------------\n\n  PER CONTATTI:\n\n  - Academy: https://academy.leonardotamiano.xyz\n  - Website: https://leonardotamiano.xyz\n  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-tamiano-707591236"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"34:36","SPEAKERS":"Bwave ICT","DATE":"2022-08-29T10:03:34-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKmeBHLTrc","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs For Complete Beginners","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"34:36","SPEAKERS":"Bwave ICT","DATE":"2022-08-29T10:03:34-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwKmeBHLTrc","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs For Complete Beginners","DESCRIPTION":"Everything you need to know using emacs as a text editor.\n  This video is made for complete beginners who haven't even heard of or used emacs before.

This took longer than I expected, and I became frustrated with Emacs' lack of documentation on the one feature the entire editor is based on (modes). We do eventually get it working. After this, we decide to alter how functions are parsed in order to (hopefully) have less code duplication and better semantics when it comes to parsing types of function parameters, as well as the function return type itself. This is (like it sounds) kind of a giant task, so we don't finish this in this video, and end up getting stuck at a bug near the end of the stream. Luckily, we've figured out what the bug was caused by, and we will begin next stream by fixing the bug and moving on with our lives :^).\n\n  I do want to say I'm sorry for this stream :/. I feel like I didn't bring the proper mindset to the stream and I don't like how I treated some of the viewers and chatters while I was frustrated. It is something I will do my best to be better at; you viewers don't deserve having to listen to me yell at my computer screen why it's not working :p.

Esto fue (como sospechaba) porque el comando 'cp' no copió el archivo. Esto no ocurre al clonar el repositorio, que además es la mejor práctica (o usando bien cp|rsync).\n   - Use Package tiene otra opción muy útil que no me di cuenta de comentar, y es defer, que permite retrasar la carga del paquete hasta que estés inactivo por N segundos.

Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.\n\n  In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:12","SPEAKERS":"dickmao","DATE":"2022-08-07T08:31:56-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H1Pe9HkJ7I","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Multithreading: How Hard Could It Be?","DESCRIPTION":"https://github.com/commercial-emacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"15:00","SPEAKERS":"Matemáticas y barcos","DATE":"2022-08-04T09:23:33-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n15j9a_h_f0","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"introducción a EMACS (Tutorial)","DESCRIPTION":"Pequeña introducción al editor de código EMACS. Aunque se trata de un editor más bien antigua, emacs presenta algunas características interesantes, como su flexibilidad y adaptabilidad. Este editor se basa en el lenguaje Lisp (\"LISt Processor\", o \"Procesamiento de Listas\"). En este vídeo, veremos cómo movernos por el archivo de código, como copiar y pegar texto, cómo navegar por otros archivos desde la misma ventana o cómo buscar y reemplazar cadenas de texto.\n\n  ¡ Esperamos que este contenido te sirva y sea de tu interés !\n\n\n  Si te interesa el tema del diseño de veleros, no dejes de visitar esta web: https://navalapp.com\n  Allí encontrarás una comunidad muy activa e interesada en este tema, además de varios cursos sobre diseño de embarcaciones a vela:\n\n  1) Curso sobre diseño de veleros: https://navalapp.com/courses/sailing-yacht-design-1/\n  Este curso incluye teoría y práctica sobre el embarcaciones a vela. Usando Maxsurf, realizaremos el diseño de una carena y sus apéndices. Además aprenderemos a hacer el cálculo de resistencia al avance y la estabilidad, también usando Maxsurf.\n\n  2) Curso sobre escantillonado de veleros con ISO-12215: https://navalapp.com/courses/scantling-with-iso-12215/\n  Este curso trata de la aplicación de la norma ISO 12215 al escantillonado de estructuras de veleros. Se trata de un curso eminentemente práctico, donde aprenderás los detalles de la norma ISO 12215 a través del ejemplo con un barco concreto. Para ese barco, se calcularán el escantillonado a través de ejemplos a mano y utilizando el software SCT. El curso incluye una licencia temporal gratuita de este software. Más información sobre el software SCT aquí: http://www.boatscantlings.com\n\n  Además de estos, podrás encontrar otros cursos de otros temas relacionados con el mundo de las embarcaciones a vela. De estos cursos no somos nosotros los autores pero son igual de interesantes.\n\n\n  Aparte de eso, en Matemáticas y barcos nos interesa el tema de los CFD en general, y su aplicación a la ingeniería naval, en particular. Sobre este tema, podrás encontrar también un par de cursos de los que somos autores:\n\n  3) Curso sobre OpenFoam: https://ingeoexpert.com/cursos/curso-de-simulacion-numerica-de-fluidos-con-openfoam/\n  En este curso aprenderás los rudimentos del CFD OpenFoam a través de varios ejemplos de aplicación:  \"Cavity\", los problemas de Couette y Poiselle, un perfil aerodinámico y un Dam Break.\n\n  4) Curso sobre CFD para aplicaciones navales (OpenFoam):\n  https://ingenierojorgejuan.com/es/c/109/simulacion-numerica-para-aplicaciones-navales\n  En este curso podrás aprender algunas aplicaciones más avanzadas centradas en casos de interés práctico en ingeniería naval. Estos casos son:\n  - Un ensayo de remolque.\n  - Un ensayo de propulsor aislado, es decir: la simulación del flujo en una hélice para obtener sus curvas de funcionamiento.\n  - Un ensayo de plataforma flotante en olas.\n\n\n  Puedes encontrar más sobre nosotros en:\n  1) LinkedIn:\n  https://www.linkedin.com/in/pe-merino-alonso\n  https://www.linkedin.com/in/javiercalderons/\n  2) Twitter:\n  https://twitter.com/eleazar_13\n  https://twitter.com/calderonsj7\n\n\n  Esperamos verte pronto de nuevo por el canal y, sobre todo, que disfrutes y aprendas con nuestro contenido. ¡ Hasta la próxima !"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"10:27","SPEAKERS":"Bhaskar Chowdhury  ...Musing with GNU_Linux!!","DATE":"2022-08-07T15:42:46-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDy1gQOHyhs","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Which Key Is A Damn Good Package To Have 2022_08_08_03:44:58","DESCRIPTION":"In this video, you will see, how a specific package can assist you to work efficiently and smoothly on Emacs.\n\n  #linux #emacs #which_key_package #linuxadmin #sysadmin #opensource #Gentoo #Debian #Slackware #research\n  #linuxkernel #kernel #gnu #Linux #GNU\n\n  Buy Me A Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unixbhaskar\n  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  You can also find me :\n\n  GITHUB: https://github.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/unixbhaskar\n\n  Blogs: https://unixbhaskar.wordpress.com\n\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  LinkedIN: https://linkedin.com/in/unixbhaskar\n\n  Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  Goodreads: https://goodreads.com/unixbhaskar"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:02:00","SPEAKERS":"Xah Lee","DATE":"2022-08-05T02:06:40-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBGvGFmo1ps","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"emacs regular expression, and in emacs lisp","DESCRIPTION":"notes at http://xahlee.info/talk_show/xah_talk_show_2022-08-04.html\n      what's regex\n      why not wildcard (glob)\n      simple example of regex\n      emacs regex, by interactive command, or in emacs lisp. there are different.\n      emacs regex commands. best way to test regex.\n      emacs regex syntax basics.\n      regex in emacs lisp.\n      best way to test regex in emacs lisp.\n      ways to convert regex from command to emacs lisp string."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"07:14","SPEAKERS":"Blackberry Boy","DATE":"2022-08-05T19:00:04-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D92eX68kxjQ","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:","TAGS":":org:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Org-mode - Emacs customize face to change background colour","DESCRIPTION":"Become my channel member: https://www.sparxsys.com/join\n\n  You can change the background colour and lot of other colours in your emacs using customize-face.\n\n  #Emacs #backgroundcolour\n\n  ####\n  Become Jira master: https://www.youtube.com/ravisagar1/join\n  Need my help?

If I execute to this line it takes a few\n  07:38  seconds... it says Success!!! and now we can\n  07:40  show the .pdf. And: ta-da!\n  07:44  this is the figure that I wanted to show.\n  07:47  So, that's it. Again: this is a\n  07:53  library that is not interesting in\n  07:55  itself, but\n  07:56  i think that the way in which it can be\n  07:58  tested - which is very similar to the way\n  08:01  in which I'm developing it\n  08:03  is interesting in itself - so\n  08:05  if you are interested in test blocks\n  08:08  please test this,\n  08:10  and send feedback. That's it! bye =)"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"00:51","SPEAKERS":"Anand Tamariya","DATE":"2022-04-22T07:51:57-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/HJxGiTOHXjo","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"GNU Emacs as a lightweight Java IDE - 4 (Getter/Setter)","DESCRIPTION":"Details:\n  https://lifeofpenguin.blogspot.com/2021/04/gnu-emacs-as-lightweight-ide.html\n\n\n  Emacs config\n\n  (global-ede-mode 1)\n  (semantic-mode 1)\n  (srecode-minor-mode 1)\n  (ede-enable-generic-projects)\n\n  Part 1 (Auto-suggest): https://youtu.be/MWpvKSTz4qc\n  Part 2 (Refactoring): https://youtu.be/zmRac_BNbv0\n  Part 3 (Debugging): https://youtu.be/U2L0iLZI_cE\n  Part 4 (Getter/Setter): https://youtu.be/HJxGiTOHXjo"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"03:43","SPEAKERS":"Bhaskar Chowdhury  ...Musing with GNU_Linux!!","DATE":"2022-04-24T04:14:25-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbpVAmWTFTU","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Curated List Of Apps And Utility By The Community 2022 04 24 16:22:17","DESCRIPTION":"In this video, you will see, emacs enthusiasts, and community members built a curated list of apps and utilities for the people.\n\n  Here you can find all those: https://github.com/emacs-tw/awesome-emacs\n\n\n  Buy Me A Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/unixbhaskar\n  Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  You can also find me :\n\n  GITHUB: https://github.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/user/unixbhaskar\n\n  Blogs: https://unixbhaskar.wordpress.com\n\n  Twitter: https://twitter.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  LinkedIN: https://linkedin.com/in/unixbhaskar\n\n  Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/unixbhaskar\n\n  Goodreads: https://goodreads.com/unixbhaskar"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"06:44","SPEAKERS":"Timothy Unkert","DATE":"2022-04-14T05:30:00-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_fACZ_o9Q","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Installing Packages Manually in Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"In this video I show you how to install packages manually in Emacs without the help of Elpa, Melpa or Non GNU Elpa.\n\n  Emacs logo attribution:\n  Kentaro Ohkouchi, GPLv3 http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html, via Wikimedia Commons"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"57:23","SPEAKERS":"M-x Research","DATE":"2022-04-13T13:40:00-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NBAmkHHFS0","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Functional programming: an (Emacs) Lisp view 2/n","DESCRIPTION":"Second talk of 2022 at the M-x Research group by Jens Jensen\n\n  This talk aims to demonstrate functional programming principles and power tools using (mostly Emacs) Lisp.

The user types an argument fragment, and Emacs suggests possible completions for that fragment. Completions make emacs faster and easier for the user.\n\n  Examples of when completions are used:\n    Run command (M-x)\n    Switch buffer (C-x b)\n    Find file (C-x C-f)\n    Get info (C-h R)\n    Etc.\n\n  Vertico is a nice Completion UI.\n\n  The full list of standard completion styles are provided by the variable completion-styles-alist.\n    orderless\n    emacs21\n    emacs22\n    basic\n    partial-completion\n    substring\n    flex\n    initials\n\n  You can set the completion styles you want to use with the variable completion-styles.\n  (setq completion-styles '(basic substring orderless))\n\n  Question: Since we're providing a list of styles, which one is used? Answer: Emacs will use the first style that produces results.\n\n  Question: How do I know how each style behaves? Answer: Use just one style and see how it behaves. Or read the Info Manual.\n\n  Question: Why does emacs prepend styles to the front of my completion-styles list? Answer: Emacs has a set of category styles that it prepends by default (see completion-category-defaults). You can override the defaults (see completion-category-overrides).\n\n  To learn more, see the Help for the variable above or see the Emacs code in minibuffer.el."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"02:52","SPEAKERS":"Timothy Unkert","DATE":"2022-02-11T18:30:06-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FguHD-eY2N0","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Macros and HTML","DESCRIPTION":"In this video I show you a quick way to write a lot of html with Emacs macros.\n\n  Emacs logo attribution:\n  Kentaro Ohkouchi, GPLv3 http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n  File URL:\n  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Emacs_512.png\n\n  Page URL:\n  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emacs_512.png\n\n  HTML 5 logo:\n  https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Logo.svg\n\n  Pexels photo in background:\n  https://www.pexels.com/photo/abstract-business-code-coder-270348/"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:43","SPEAKERS":"Brent Westbrook","DATE":"2022-02-08T09:23:55-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZEgtWfi_3w","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs from Source Part 5: Rust setup with rustic","DESCRIPTION":"In this video I build off the configuration in Part 4 to add support for the Rust programming language, which I also install in the VM.

It is unique as a bookmark manager in that it is designed to interoperate as part of a larger system of personal knowledge management and productivity tools.\n  It achieves this interoperability by saving your data into an accessible plain text file written in the emacs standard org-mode format. Org mode is a set of plain text tools used to manage tasks, to do lists, notes, links, journal entries and almost any form of text-based information.\n\n  Most org mode users interact with it via the emacs text editor but it can be used in any text editor and is increasingly used as a format by other tools such as the LogSeq* personal knowledge manager, the Flat Habits iOS ToDo manager and Plain Org an iOS org-mode editor.\n\n  Here I show how the notes, links and todo items captured by BrainTool in your browser can be accessed and edited in org mode and then used to drive a task manager. The same plain text file is also shown synced to LogSeq and being navigated in the LogSeq user interface.\n\n  All three tools are automatically kept in sync by virtue of using the same org mode file as backing store. Currently this requires syncing BrainTool to a Google Drive file and using the Google Sync app to sync your GDrive to a desktop folder. Emacs and LogSeq can then read and write the BrainTool data file locally. Some care needs to be taken to allow time for the local and remote files to sync before moving between tools.\n\n  If you are new to BrainTool the other videos in this playlist give a short introduction."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"19:23","SPEAKERS":"Brent Westbrook","DATE":"2022-01-27T16:27:42-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4911q_SnGDU","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs from Source Part 2: vertico, orderless, and marginalia","DESCRIPTION":"In this video we continue the Emacs From Source series by setting up the completion system vertico for Emacs, along with a new completion-style from the orderless package, and some completion UI enhancements from marginalia.

Luckily they are all pretty simple. In fact, you can just... install them and copy/paste some stuff and be on your way! I wanted to understand these emacs packages though, and that's a little more challenging.\n\n  Ivy is a package that helps you search. It helps you do things in M-x, or find file, and Dired, etc... Anything where you look for something in Emacs, Ivy can come to the rescue and help you type less.\n\n  For example. Let's say I want to look through some Melpa packages. No longer do I have to type package-list-packages.  Instead, I can just type \"pa li packa\"  and Ivy will find all the results that match the search terms. Using spaces, you can target certain parts of what you're looking for. It just helps you type less.\n\n  Ivy doesn't rely on anything, but Swiper will automatically pull in Ivy when it's installed, because Swiper needs Ivy. Swiper does the same thing as Ivy, but replaces isearch, so you can use ivy features when searching through text.\n\n  Counsel gives you extra functions that aren't normally available. For example: You can open a buffer or file in a new window.\n\n  These packages integrate with a LOT of other emacs packages, so it's really"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:02:25","SPEAKERS":"Zaiste Programming","DATE":"2021-03-16T02:12:51-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKegZI9vWUU","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs, Doom, Vim, Lisp & Games - with Henrik Lissner, Emacs Doom Creator","DESCRIPTION":"An interview with Henrik Lissner, the creator of Emacs Doom."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"06:37","SPEAKERS":"myTerminal","DATE":"2021-03-05T08:58:42-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4QPtWCGFJ8","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"I split my Emacs configuration and made it adaptive","DESCRIPTION":"As I celebrate my 7 years with Emacs, I briefly talk about a few major changes to the project since it was first created.

Using R to explore and comprehend information is just one part of this process. One usually needs a tool for code writing and interpreting at the very least and another tool for the textual side. Emacs and its Org-mode is an outlining combo that makes the whole process more consistent and more transparent in terms of scientific reproducibility. It allows every piece of research that makes up the publication to be written together in one text file. It can be compiled then and exported in one move to the format desired – most preferably LaTeX and PDF. The benefits of using R in such context and a software toolset have been examined in the writing of a comprehensive study of the Muslim necropolis on Kom el-Dikka. The study was based on a dataset drawn from analyses of skeletal remains of over 2,500 individuals excavated to date. The data was supplemented with archaeological investigation of almost 2,000 grave units to shed light on the changes that occurred in early Islamic Alexandria.\n\n\n  Robert Mahler"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"12:15","SPEAKERS":"nobiot","DATE":"2020-11-01T04:27:54-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO_JEXUeGkI&feature=share","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Org-transclusion (alpha v0.0.4) Demo #4","DESCRIPTION":"GitHub repo: https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion\n  Org-roam Discourse forum for discussion: https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/prototype-transclusion-block-reference-with-emacs-org-mode/830/36\n\n  Other videos related to Org-transclusion:\n  How to install video: https://youtu.be/c1aelYM3m9U"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"13:46","SPEAKERS":"Jan Boone","DATE":"2020-11-02T05:10:19-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2QteNGlMYM","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":python:","TAGS":":python:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"doing your own OLS and lasso with emacs and python","DESCRIPTION":"This screencast helps students with the notebook of the course Seminar Datascience for Economics\n\n\n  website of the course: https://janboone.github.io/msc_datascience/index.html\n\n\n  screencast page of the course: https://janboone.github.io/msc_datascience/pagescreencasts.html\n\n\n  notebook for the course: https://github.com/janboone/msc_datascience/blob/master/Statistical_Hacking.ipynb"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"11:29","SPEAKERS":"Jan Boone","DATE":"2020-11-02T04:02:35-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69zsXfKib2o","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":python:","TAGS":":python:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"bootstrapping difference mean samples with emacs and python","DESCRIPTION":"This screencast helps students with the notebook of the course Seminar Datascience for Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n  website of the course: https://janboone.github.io/msc_datascience/index.html\n\n\n\n\n  screencast page of the course: https://janboone.github.io/msc_datascience/pagescreencasts.html\n\n\n\n\n  notebook for the course: https://github.com/janboone/msc_datascience/blob/master/Statistical_Hacking.ipynb"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"12:04","SPEAKERS":"GDQuest","DATE":"2019-08-26T09:59:52-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSKbNQ1EBxo&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Spacemacs Jumps: jumping around your code (tutorial)","DESCRIPTION":"Here are some of the features I like and use the most in Spacemacs to navigate code fast.\n  Get our game creation courses: https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses\n  Our Spacemacs tutorials: http://bit.ly/spacemacs-tutorials\n\n  \"Cheatsheet\": https://www.gdquest.com/open-source/cheatsheets/spacemacs/\n  Get Spacemacs: http://spacemacs.org/\n\n  Discord ► https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z\n  Twitter ► https://twitter.com/nathangdquest\n\n  This video is licensed under the CC-By 4.0 license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n  You can attribute it to \"GDQuest and contributors - https://www.gdquest.com/\""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"34:51","SPEAKERS":"Eivind Fonn","DATE":"2015-10-24T08:23:56-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFV5EqpZ6_s&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Spacemacs ABC (1)","DESCRIPTION":"We're touring through SPC with which-key by our side.

Magit aims to improve upon Git commands in order to make simple things faster and complicated things simple.\n\n  Magit is already included and configured in Emacs Doom. You can use SPC g g to initiate the status page. Most Git commands are done from this status page. The status page provides comprehensive information about the current context changes. You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.\n\n  In this episode we learn how to merge pull requests directly from Emacs using Magit and the Forge package.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  If you liked this video (or any of the previous ones), please, consider supporting my efforts via GitHub Sponsors\n  https://github.com/sponsors/zaiste\n\n  Your sponsorship will help me make even better videos & release them more often. ;)\n\n  Join the Discord channel for discussions: https://discord.gg/eK6HjjG\n\n  #emacs #magit #git"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"17:35","SPEAKERS":"K LM","DATE":"2017-10-07T09:14:16-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXB3I3S3vJc&feature=youtu.be&t=387","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Practical Chicken Scheme with Emacs: hello-world webserver","DESCRIPTION":"Make a simple hello-world webserver using Chicken Scheme.

Usually they are generated with scripts (either .py or.ipynb`), and a natural way of maintaining these scripts is using either a long script file or multiple short files.\n\n  When one has to update these outputs, the usual workflow is: 1) find the file(s) and code block(s) inside the file that contains the code for output generation, 2) re-learn what you did so you can edit the code, and 3) run the code to generate new outputs.\n\n  Each of these steps has a cognitive overhead (non-fluency), which hampers your productivity, especially if it has been a while since you looked at them. Using IPython Notebook facilitates some of the procedures but it does not solve everything.\n\n  In this talk, I introduce org-mode and some of its functionalities for all three steps. org-mode is ideal for managing these tasks because it can minimize the non-fluency. It has a convenient and flexible markup syntax for hierarchical documents. It uses tree-like headlines, which make it very easy to organize code and text. It provides a convenient way to collapse or expand headline blocks and navigate through them. In addition, one can execute a code block or export the results (or the source code itself) conveniently inside org-mode. Theoretically, one can have the entire contents and code for a paper and a presentation inside one org file. I show examples of how one can leverage these functionalities to maintain outputs."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:04:16","SPEAKERS":"thoughtbot","DATE":"2014-11-10T11:18:00-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnt_PWoM5Y&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":org:research:","TAGS":":org:research:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Org-mode for Reproducible Research","DESCRIPTION":"The amazing Emacs org-mode has myriad uses and features including outlining, note-taking, table management, and publishing to HTML and LaTeX. It’s also a fabulous tool to help make your research reproducible. From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research):\n  In 2012, a survey done for Nature found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers on the subject of cancer were irreproducible (http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html)… Researchers explained in a 2006 study that, of 249 data sets from American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 73% of contacted authors did not respond with their data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17032082) over a 6-month period.\n\n  Org-mode allows authors to include their datasets and all programs that were run to generate figures and text. Included files can be used to facilitate version control. While there are limits to this approach—including data generation and software versioning—it represents a big advance in reproducibility and one which has not yet been widely adopted.\n\n  Learn more from the developers at thoughtbot ⌨️\n  Head over to http://tbot.io/dev-blog to read more great articles on our blog."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:39","SPEAKERS":"Emacks Notes","DATE":"2018-08-17T22:31:59-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He83coKoq7o&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Use Xwidget Webkit to browse the Web, right within your Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"This video demonstrates how to fill forms using Emacs' Xwidget Webkit browser.

Inserting new columns and rearranging them is a single key binding!\n\n  What makes org (and orgtbl) mode even more powerful is the spreadsheet capabilities.  You can define formula which will be used to calculate values of given cell or a group of cells (ie. a column).  And because the underlying evaluation mechanism is Emacs' calc mode you can calculate almost anything!

It uses the Vim bindings and includes a nice, sensible configuration that is easy to modify.\n\n  REFERENCED:\n  ► https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\n\n  WANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL?\n  💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube\n  💳 Paypal: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=derek%40distrotube%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=DistroTube&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest\n  🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n  👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\n  SOCIAL PLATFORMS:\n  🗨️ Mastodon: https://mastodon.technology/@distrotube\n  💬 IRC: irc://freenode #distrotube\n  👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n\n  DT ON THE WEB:\n  🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n  🌐 Gopherhole: gopher://distro.tube\n  📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1\n\n  FREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n  📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n  🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n  🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n  🔊 Audacity: https://www.audacityteam.org/\n  💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n\n  Your support is very much appreciated.

This turns programming into a conversation between programmers and their compilers, where Emacs acts as an intermediary. However, programmers are limited in the kinds of questions they can ask. Recent work on extensible editor actions leverages metaprogramming techniques to specify how the compiler should answer custom questions, but that requires writing code in Emacs Lisp to glue the compiler and the editor interface because metaprograms can only command the compiler and not the editor itself.\n\n  In this talk, I will describe editor metaprogramming, a novel idea of writing metaprograms that command the editor. I define a monadic embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) for editor commands in Coq, which enables composing these commands in meaningful ways, with the full power of Coq! I will write an interpreter for this eDSL in Emacs Lisp, and make Emacs and Coq processes communicate back and forth. Coq computations will be sent back to Coq, and effectful editor actions such as deleting a character and moving the cursor will be executed in Emacs Lisp.\n\n  Presenter: Joomy Korkut\n  Presented at the Scheme workshop 2019: https://icfp19.sigplan.org/home/scheme-2019, part of ICFP'19: icfp19.sigplan.org"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"21:18","SPEAKERS":"DistroTube","DATE":"2019-10-04T15:20:05-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8koAgkBEnM&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Switching to GNU Emacs","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"21:18","SPEAKERS":"DistroTube","DATE":"2019-10-04T15:20:05-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8koAgkBEnM&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Switching to GNU Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"So you guys have been asking for me to take a look at GNU Emacs.

You can easily see files diffs and selectively stage parts of a file.\n\n  In this episode we are reviewing the the committing flow in Git using Magit. It goes from selecting changes through tagging particular commits up to pushing to remote repositories. This showcase some additional Magit's features compared to the flow discussed in the previous episode.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer. It can be used as a base for your own configuration, or as a battery-included Emacs distribution. Emacs Doom is also smaller and faster than similar Emacs distributions (such as Spacemacs). Doom is known for its polished UI and focus on usability.\n\n  In this series I will go over most of the packages included in Emacs Doom by default. As this Emacs distribution is oriented towards Vim people, most of the keybindings differ significantly from the vanilla Emacs. Also, the packages discussed are not unique to Emacs Doom, they can be installed separately; Emacs Doom provides only some sane defaults.\n\n  #emacs #emacsdoom #magit"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"18:22","SPEAKERS":"Protesilaos Stavrou","DATE":"2019-10-09T01:40:26-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/bdcqRziKYT0","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs: comment functions and their behaviour","DESCRIPTION":"Demo of the built-in Emacs functions for commenting structured text.

Growing up and attending college in Calgary, Alberta, Gosling began his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in 1977, finishing in 1983. While at CMU, Gosling developed the first Unix version of Emacs, learned about byte codes while porting PERQ software to VAX, and developed the Andrew window system. After a brief stint at IBM working on a RISC computer, Gosling joined Sun in 1984, and created the NeWS window system. After NeWS lost to X Windows in the marketplace, a group including Gosling formed the Green project at the end of 1990 to explore consumer technologies, producing the Star7, a multimedia remote control. It was for Star7 that Gosling first created the Oak language, later renamed Java. After a brief spin-out from Sun as the company FirstPerson and an unsuccessful foray into interactive cable TV, Gosling’s team repurposed Java for the Web in 1994, which enabled dynamic and interactive web pages at a time when most were static. Sun partnered with Netscape to include Java with the Navigator browser in 1995. Sun’s goal was for Java to become a network-centric, platform-independent platform that would free computers from proprietary systems like Microsoft. While Java is less popular than other languages on PCs and web browsers, it has become the dominant language in enterprise computing, and a major player in mobile and embedded computing.\n\n  * Note:  Transcripts represent what was said in the interview.

Avy is one of the most powerful packages in Emacs that provide such text-jumping functionality.\n\n  Once you get used to Avy, it is almost as if you can move the cursor using your eyes, just by looking where you want it to be placed.\n\n  Doom is an Emacs configuration for the Stubborn Martian Vimmer.

This combination of software enables researchers to intertwine narrative and mathematical text with figures and code that is executable within a document, with capture of the output. Portions of the document can be selectively exported to LaTeX, HTML, pdf and other other formats. We have used this method to produce technical manuscripts submitted for peer review in scientific journals, in the preparation of two e-books (about 300 pages each) on using python in scientific and engineering applications (http://jkitchin.github.com/pycse), and in using python in the modeling of the properties of materials with density functional theory (http://jkitchin.github.com/dft-book), as well as a python-powered blog at http://jkitchin.github.com. Our experience suggests all three components are critical for enabling reproducible research in practice: an extensible editor, a markup language that separates text, math, data and code, and an effective language such as python.

This provides, amongst other things, a near-identical replication of vim within emacs. Seasoned vim users can access unparalleled configurability and extendability of emacs, without the need to learn new keybindings for editing. The configuration is designed to make emacs easily discoverable and make common configurations simple. Vanilla emacs users can have the convenience of simple modular configuration, whilst taking advantage of a powerful modular configuration and switching between vim and emacs style with a single keystroke."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"00:30","SPEAKERS":"Jiahao Li","DATE":"2018-04-16T06:58:53-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrFmfFZfj-A","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"el-fly-indent-mode demo: Indent Emacs Lisp on the fly","DESCRIPTION":"Indent Emacs Lisp on the fly\n  For more information see\n  https://github.com/jiahaowork/el-fly-indent-mode.el"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:57","SPEAKERS":"Chris Stryczynski","DATE":"2018-04-15T05:01:20-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Il7zS5_vXQ","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Ranger integration with emacs / spacemacs","DESCRIPTION":"Instructions and configs: https://github.com/chrissound/RangerEmacs"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"13:19","SPEAKERS":"Uncle Dave","DATE":"2018-03-10T03:41:40-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSzxZWB9Qkg","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Tutorial 18 - Mark multiple and a few other things!","DESCRIPTION":""},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"13:19","SPEAKERS":"Uncle Dave","DATE":"2018-03-10T03:41:40-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSzxZWB9Qkg","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Tutorial 18 - Mark multiple and a few other things!","DESCRIPTION":"A few tiny extensions and fixes to make our emacs even better!\n\n  God bless 'mark-next-like-this"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"11:53","SPEAKERS":"Uncle Dave","DATE":"2018-03-11T12:05:47-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39u8K12rXHE","BLOCKED":"","ALLTAGS":":yasnippet:","TAGS":":yasnippet:","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Tutorial 20 - Yasnippet!","DESCRIPTION":"Do stuff faster!\n  Yasnippets are awesome, and ridiculously easy to understand and configure.\n  Enjoy!"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"15:50","SPEAKERS":"Uncle Dave","DATE":"2018-03-10T03:50:58-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeWZfruRu6k","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Emacs Tutorial 19 - Completion - Company for C/C++","DESCRIPTION":"The start of a series within a series where we take a look at improving emacs' IDE-like capabilities.\n  In this one, we get company to work, with irony mode for c/c++.\n  For the next ones, we will set up a better environment for python/clisp/lua/bash etc."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"04:10","SPEAKERS":"Joseph Wilk","DATE":"2018-02-27T02:07:10-08:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://youtu.be/Vrx_EcOTlTc","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"Shaping Sound with Emacs","DESCRIPTION":"Teenage Engineering taught me  the idea of playful music.\n  #Emacs can  be as playful.

This is a significant improvement upon the default because you can switch between emacs windows & frames using the arrow keys.\n\n  Instead of being limited to forward and backward, you can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, which can dramatically improve your speed.\n\n  Unfortunately, the arrow keys are too far away. Any good programmer will keep his or her hands on the keyboard as much as possible, and not waste their time reaching for the arrow keys unless necessary.\n\n  Luckily, there's a simple improvement to allow you to switch between Emacs windows and frames even quicker.  By editing your .emacs configuration, you can adjust the windmove and framemove shortcuts to be bound to the keys \"H\", \"J\", \"K\", and \"L\".\n\n  If you look closely, you'll notice those keys are right under your fingers when you're typing, so it's much easier and faster to move between frames and windows!"},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"37:04","SPEAKERS":"abo-abo","DATE":"2017-07-24T14:29:46-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONHEDj3kWrE&feature=youtu.be","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"hydra el @ london el","DESCRIPTION":"This is the recording of my screen from my talk at the london.el Emacs meetup: https://www.meetup.com/London-Emacs-Hacking/events/241399003/."},{"CATEGORY":"videos","DURATION":"01:08:46","SPEAKERS":"media.ccc.de","DATE":"2016-05-27T11:01:28-07:00","YOUTUBE_URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYnq8yFvZwM","BLOCKED":"","FILE":"/home/sacha/proj/emacstv.github.io/videos.org","PRIORITY":"B","ITEM":"TimoB: Emacs - Beating the Learning Curve","DESCRIPTION":"https://media.ccc.de/v/gpn16-7646-emacs_-_beating_the_learning_curve\n\n  Wer bislang nur bunte, langsame IDEs verwendet hat, kann bei uns lernen was man mit Meta-X alles machen kann.

If my player is somewhere in the current subtitle, it'll use that timestamp. If not, it'll make a reasonable guess based on character position.\n\n  I can use subed-word-data.el to load word-level times from WhisperX JSON or from Youtube SRV2 files. This allows me to split a subtitle using the timestamp for that word.\n\n  Because subed-word-data colours words based on transcription confidence, I can see where something might need to be closely examined, like when there's no timing information for the words at the start or end.\n\n  If I combine that with subed-waveform, I can see silences. Then I can tweak start times by shift-left-clicking on the waveform. This automatically adjusts the end time of the previous subtitle too.\n\n  I like how Emacs makes it easy to use word timing data when editing captions.

I can even rearrange things and get rid of anything I don't want.Then I use subed-convert to turn it into a VTT file. I can tweak the start and end times by looking at the waveforms. Then I add comments with the visuals I want. I can add images, animated GIFs, or videos, and they're automatically squeezed or stretched to fit. I can also have them play at original speed.
